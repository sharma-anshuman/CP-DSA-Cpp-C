# Data-structures-and-algorithms
All the basic and advanced data structures and algorithms implemented either in C or C++. This is the part of my data structures and analysis of algorithms laboratory work in which I wrote the following codes by myself. Any contributions and PRs' having some new algorithms and using some different data structures are most welcome to enhance the diversity of the current repository.
Some of the algorithms Implemented in the these problems are:
~Constructuve Algorithms
~Dijkistra Algorithm
~String Manipulation
~Bellman Ford Algorithm
~Divide and Conquer Method
~Dynamic Programming
~Greedy Algorithms
~Backtracking Algorithm
~Kurskal Algorithm
~Bit manipulation
~Implementation of data structures like linked list and Stacks are there along with the codes for Merge sort and Quick sort using recursion.
